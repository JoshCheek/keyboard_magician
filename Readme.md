Keyboard Magician
=================

A typing tutor.

MVP: It has one typing challenge which works on the unix command line

Future features that prob won't get added b/c I'm lazy and have attention deficit disoh hey look, a squirrel!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* allow multiple challenges (e.g. boring to type the same sentence over and over)
* allow "tracks" ie a series of ordered challenges
* allow adding custom challenges
* have the cursor follow along with the position in the text
* allow option to be displayed just below the output
* allow optoin to be displayed side-by-side with the output
* allow vim and emacs keybindings
* allow iterative challenges (more like real life, e.g. shows one thing, once you've hit that, it becomes modified, and you have to modify your output as quickly as possible)
* make a web version with opal
